# Major Project Proposal

## Project Description
A rhythm game for a few songs that I haven't found good rhythm games for :D 

- Games for reference
    - Rhythm Hive --> Mostly wanting to do songs aside from Hybe artists for this reason
    - Osu --> More accessible in terms of testing when needed (Don't need a touch screen)
    - Superstar JYP(?) --> Idea came from this because I tried it and it wasn't very good compared to Rhythm Hive
    - Beat Saber --> VR game but the idea of directions could be interesting 
    - DDR(?) --> Could consider arrow keys 
    - The one hammer or photograph-lighter game(?) --> Simpler idea of only using one key 

## Needs to Have 
- Basic tap tiles and hold tiles 
- Music that matches up with the tiles 
- Selection menu 
    - At least 2-3 songs [Start with 2]
- Basic scoring + display at end of each level
    - Display/some kind of signal that the tile was hit
- Decently visually appealing
    - Not just basic colours and elements
    - Title/opening screen and ending/level completion screen along with selection and gameplay screens 

## Nice to Have 
- Slide (sliding from one spot to an adjacent one) tiles and swipe (on a touch device, swiping up) tiles 
    - Could change it to consider whether on a pc or a touchscreen device 
- Selection of colours/theme
- Multiple levels of difficulty or more songs
    - Easy, normal, hard (+ maybe extreme?)
- Highscore board
- Moving/video background

## Far Far Beyond
- Ability to make your own maps?
    - Upload music and plan map?
